# Pig Game vs Computer. 
Reach the total score to 100, by rolling the dice and adding the score. Hold the value of your current bank to add it to your total and pass the chance to the computer. If you roll the dice to One, your current bank will reset to 0 and no score will be added to the total. Try your luck and race the computer to reach 100.

**Changed** the Player vs Player game to **Player vs Computer.**

Adding the logic and functionality to the computer, when to roll the dice, to choose when to hold the value.

Implemented setTimeout and recursion.
